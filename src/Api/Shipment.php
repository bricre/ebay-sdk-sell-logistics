     * This method creates a &quot;shipment&quot; based on the shippingQuoteId and
     * rateId values supplied in the request. The rate identified by the rateId value
     * specifies the carrier and service for the package shipment, and the rate ID must
     * be contained in the shipping quote identified by the shippingQuoteId value. Call
     * createShippingQuote to retrieve a set of live shipping rates. When you create a
     * shipment, eBay generates a shipping label that you can download and use to ship
     * your package. In a createFromShippingQuote request, sellers can include a list
     * of shipping options they want to add to the base service quoted in the selected
     * rate. The list of available shipping options is specific to each quoted rate and
     * if available, the options are listed in the rate container of the of the
     * shipping quote. In addition to a configurable return-to location and other
     * details about the shipment, the response to this method includes: The shipping
     * carrier and service to be used for the package shipment A list of selected
     * shipping options, if any The shipment tracking number The total shipping cost
     * (the sum cost of the base shipping service and any added options) When you
     * create a shipment, your billing agreement account is charged the sum of the
     * baseShippingCost and the total cost of any additional shipping options you might
     * have selected. Use the URL returned in labelDownloadUrl field, or call
     * downloadLabelFile with the shipmentId value from the response, to download a
     * shipping label for your package. Important! Sellers must set up their payment
     * method with eBay before they can use this method to create a shipment and the
     * associated shipping label.
